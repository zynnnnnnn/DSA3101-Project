# Covid-19 Board Opening Project
Objectives: Our project aims to identify countries that will “open up” in the near future (13 weeks or 3 months) which allows governments to establish travel bubbles or investment opportunities with the right countries. The hope is to allow such countries to restart their travel industries and possibly reboot the global economy.
